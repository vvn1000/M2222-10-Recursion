1.  Edit the file named "main.swift"

2.  Within this file, write a program which will generate the value of the specified
    factorial as follows:
    	      factorial(n) =
	      		   1				if n <= 1
			   n * factorial(n-1)		otherwise
			   
3.  The output should be as follows, demonstrating each step through the algorithm:
    At the beginning of each calculation, print:
       Calculating factorial(<n>)...

    In the terminal case, print:
       Terminal case, returning 1.

    In the non-terminal case, print:
       Non-terminal case, returning <result>.

    After the entire calculcation is complete, print:
       The final result is: <result>.
